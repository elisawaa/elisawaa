I'm an android developer with a background in full-stack web development. These days, I'm really excited about working with Jetpack Compose to seamlessly create fun and beautiful apps. I love learning new things, while simplifying and automating processes by turning them into code. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DuckTracker, an app to track the movements of wild ducks in my area.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge on the state-of-the art android.

ðŸŒº In my freetime I like reading, cycling, wildlife photography and learning languages.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love cycling and have recently started [Zwifting](https://us.zwift.com/) with a current goal of unlocking the in-game [Tron bike](https://zwiftinsider.com/unlock-the-tron-bike-in-zwift/) by climbing 50 000 meters.
